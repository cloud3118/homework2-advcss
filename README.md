# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## What It Is

 This was my first website from start to finish.  This website is my virtual portfolio that I will continually add my projects to throughout my coding development journy.  Although it is rudimentary, I am very proud of it. 



## What I did

I created both an html and css file from scratch for the 1st time.  I was able to link the style sheet to the html page and build out both per the requirements below.  I added styling of my choice and attempted to use semantic html elements to create clean code for others to follow.

I was able to to create a few effects and learn a lot along the way, such as css grid layout.  I was able to effectively embed images and make usable links to other sites.


## Acceptance Criteria I followed

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
